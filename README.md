
# Landmark Image Classification: From Scratch & Transfer Learning with PyTorch 🖼️

This project explores landmark image classification using two distinct deep learning approaches in PyTorch: building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and leveraging transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet18 model. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, `torch.jit` model export, and an interactive Jupyter Notebook application for real-time classification.

## Setup & Installation ⚙️

### Prerequisites

*   Python (3.8 or higher recommended)
*   `pip` and `virtualenv` (recommended)
*   Git

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OptimusAI01/Landmark-Classifier.git
```

### Setting up the Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you encounter issues with `jupyter nbconvert` for HTML generation (used in `create_submit_pkg.py`), you might need to install Pandoc and TeX (e.g., MiKTeX on Windows, MacTeX on macOS, or `texlive` on Linux).

### Dataset

The landmark image dataset will be automatically downloaded and extracted by the helper scripts (`src/helpers.py`) when first needed (e.g., when running `src.data.get_data_loaders`). It will be placed in a folder named `landmark_images/` in the project root.

If you have the dataset (`landmark_images.zip`) manually, you can extract it to the project root directory so that you have `landmark_images/train` and `landmark_images/test`.

---

## Usage 🚀

### 1. Data Preparation & Exploration

The helper script `src/helpers.py` contains a function `setup_env()` which handles:
*   Setting random seeds for reproducibility.
*   Downloading and extracting the dataset if not present.
*   Computing (or loading cached) mean and standard deviation of the dataset for normalization.
*   Creating a `checkpoints/` directory.

This function is often called implicitly by other scripts or notebooks when data operations are performed. You can explore data visualization in the initial cells of `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb` or `transfer_learning.ipynb`.

### 2. Training the CNN from Scratch

Open and run the cells in `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb`:
*   This notebook defines hyperparameters for training.
*   It uses `src.model.MyModel` for the custom CNN architecture.
*   Training progress is visualized, and the best model weights are saved to `checkpoints/best_val_loss.pt`.
*   The trained model is then evaluated on the test set.
*   Finally, it exports the trained custom model to `models/original_exported.pt`.

### 3. Training with Transfer Learning

Open and run the cells in `transfer_learning.ipynb`:
*   This notebook configures hyperparameters for transfer learning (e.g., using ResNet18).
*   It utilizes `src.transfer.get_model_transfer_learning` to load a pre-trained model and adapt its classifier.
*   The training process saves the best model to `checkpoints/model_transfer.pt`.
*   The fine-tuned model is evaluated, and a confusion matrix can be plotted.
*   The model is exported to `models/transfer_exported.pt` (or `checkpoints/transfer_exported.pt` as per the notebook's code, ensure consistency).

### 4. Running the Interactive Classification App

The `app.ipynb` notebook provides an interactive way to classify landmark images.

1.  **Open `app.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.**
2.  **Choose a Model:** By default, the app is configured to load one of the exported models (e.g., `models/transfer_exported.pt`). You can modify the cell:
    ```python
    # Decide which model you want to use among the ones exported
    learn_inf = torch.jit.load("models/transfer_exported.pt") # Or "models/original_exported.pt"
    ```
3.  **Run the Cells:** Execute all cells in the notebook.
4.  **Upload an Image:**
    *   Click the "Upload" button.
    *   Select an image file. You can use images from the `test/` directory or any other landmark image.
5.  **Classify:**
    *   Click the "Classify" button.
    *   The app will display the uploaded image and the top 5 predicted landmark classes with their probabilities.

### 5. Running Tests

To run the unit tests using `pytest` (ensure it's installed via `requirements.txt`):

```bash
pytest
```

This will execute tests defined in the `src/` Python files.

## Model Details 🧠

### Custom CNN

The custom CNN (`src/model.py`) is built with a sequence of:
*   Convolutional layers (`nn.Conv2d`) with increasing filter depth.
*   Batch Normalization (`nn.BatchNorm2d`) for stable training.
*   ReLU activation functions (`nn.ReLU`).
*   Dropout layers (`nn.Dropout2d`) for regularization.
*   Max Pooling layers (`nn.MaxPool2d`) for downsampling.
*   An Adaptive Average Pooling layer (`nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d`) to handle variable input sizes before the classifier.
*   Fully connected layers (`nn.Linear`) for classification, also with Batch Normalization and Dropout.
*   Xavier Uniform initialization for weights.

### Transfer Learning (ResNet18)

The transfer learning approach (`src/transfer.py`):
*   Loads a pre-trained ResNet18 model from `torchvision.models` with `pretrained=True`.
*   Freezes all parameters of the convolutional base to retain learned features.
*   Replaces the final fully connected layer (`fc`) with a new `nn.Linear` layer tailored to the number of landmark classes in our dataset. Only this new layer is trained initially.
